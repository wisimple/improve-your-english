      <h1>Direct and Indirect Questions</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Direct questions</strong> is the "normal" questions that we can ask friends, family members, and people who we
        know well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example for direct question:
        <br />
        "Where is the Bathroom?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Indirect questions</strong> are little bit formal and polite. We use them when we are talking to a person we don't
        know very well, or in professional situations, and their form is a little different.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example for indirect quetion: <br /> "Could you tell me where the Bathroom is?"
      </p>

      <h2>Phrases For Indirect Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Could you tell me...</li>
        <li>Do you know...</li>
        <li>Do you have any idea...</li>
        <li>I'd like to know...</li>
        <li>Would it be possible...</li>
        <li>I was wondering...</li>
        <li>Is there any chance...</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Direct And Indirect Question Examples</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Direct:</strong> Where is Market Street? <br />
        <strong>Indirect:</strong> Could you tell me where Market Street is? <br />
        <span className="text-red-500">
          Indirect questions with <b>is/are</b>, the verb (is) comes{" "}
          <b>
            <i>after</i>
          </b>{" "}
          the subject (Market Street).
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Direct:</strong> What time does the bank open? <br />
        <strong>Indirect:</strong> Do you know what time the bank opens? <br />
        <span className="text-red-500">
          In indirect questions we don't use the axuiliary verb <b>(do/does/did)</b>. Also you can see that the verb is "open" in
          the direct question, and "opens" in the indirect question.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Direct:</strong> Why did you move to Europe? <br />
        <strong>Indirect:</strong> I was wondering why you moved to Europe? <br />
        <span className="text-red-500">
          Again, there is no axuiliary verb <b>(did)</b> in the indirect question - it's more of a statement that invites the
          other person to give more information.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Direct:</strong> How has he managed to get in shape so quickly? <br />
        <strong>Indirect:</strong> Do you have any idea how he has managed to get in shape so qucikly? <br />
        <span className="text-red-500">
          The axuiliary verbs <b>have</b> and <b>has</b> can be used in both direct and indirect questions - but in the direct
          question "has" comes before the subject (he) and in the indirect question, "has" comes{" "}
          <b>
            <i>after</i>
          </b>{" "}
          the subject.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Direct:</strong> How much does this motocycle cost? <br />
        <strong>Indirect:</strong> I'd like to know how much this motocycle costs? <br />
        <span className="text-red-500">
          To form the direct question, remove <b>does</b> and change "cost" to "costs".
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Direct:</strong> Can you finish the project by tomorrow? <br />
        <strong>Indirect:</strong> Would it be possible for you to finish the project by tomorrow? <br />
        <span className="text-red-500">
          For direct questions with <b>can</b>, we can use the phrase "would it be possible..." to make it indirect.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Direct:</strong> Can we change the meeting to Thursday? <br />
        <strong>Indirect:</strong> Is there any chance we could change the meeting to Thursday? <br />
        <span className="text-red-500">
          "Is there any chance..." is another option for forming indirect question with <b>can</b>.
        </span>
      </p>
    </div>
